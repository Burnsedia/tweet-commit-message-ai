## tweet git commit messages in the buildinpublic sytle

I am a buzy developer and I don't always have time to promaote my work, So I am automating the twitter part of my content marketing. 
I wrote this as a shell script originally and then ported it to python so I can use it with AI and maybe turn it into a SaaS on day.
